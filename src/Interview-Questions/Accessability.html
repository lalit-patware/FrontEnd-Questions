Improving accessibility in a pagination component is crucial to ensure that all users, including those using assistive technologies, can navigate your application effectively. Here are some strategies and practices to enhance accessibility in the pagination component:

1. Use Semantic HTML Elements
Use <nav> for Navigation: Wrap the pagination controls in a <nav> element to indicate that itâ€™s a navigation section.
Use <ul> and <li> for Lists: Structure the pagination buttons as a list using <ul> and <li> to provide a clear hierarchy.
2. ARIA Attributes
Add aria-label: Provide an aria-label to the navigation element to describe its purpose.
Use aria-current: Apply aria-current="page" to the currently active page button to indicate the current page to screen readers.
3. Keyboard Navigation
Ensure that all interactive elements (buttons) are focusable and can be navigated using the keyboard.
Provide keyboard shortcuts, such as using the arrow keys to navigate through pagination.
4. Focus Management
Manage focus appropriately. For example, when a new page is loaded, focus can be set to the first element of the newly rendered content or the pagination component.
5. Visible Indicators
Ensure that active and disabled buttons have visible indicators, such as distinct styles or color contrasts, to help users differentiate between them.
6. Loading States
If loading new pages, inform users with appropriate loading indicators that are accessible, using ARIA roles like role="alert" for dynamic updates.
