### JWT Tokens (JSON Web Tokens) and API Keys are both methods of authentication, but they serve different purposes and are used in different ways. Here's a breakdown of each:

## 1. **JWT Tokens** (JSON Web Tokens)

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are commonly used in authentication and authorization scenarios.

### Structure of a JWT:
A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (`.`):
- **Header**: Contains metadata about the token, including the type of token and the hashing algorithm used.
- **Payload**: Contains the claims, which are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional metadata.
- **Signature**: Used to verify the integrity of the token. It is created by encoding the header and payload, then signing them with a secret key or a private key (in case of asymmetric signing).

**Example:**
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6ImhhYmlmZiIsImV4cCI6MTYxNjIzOTAyMn0.sW6F6yQsQUNMUnlM0uhO_0VV-_o-WVnPIf4gIkOAD7w
```

### How JWT works:
1. **User logs in** and the server authenticates the credentials.
2. The server **creates a JWT** (containing the user's information and roles) and sends it to the client.
3. The client stores the JWT (typically in local storage or cookies) and includes it in the **Authorization header** when making requests to the server: 
   ```http
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```
4. The server **validates the JWT** by checking the signature and ensuring the token hasn’t expired.
5. Once validated, the server processes the request.

### Key Features of JWT:
- **Stateless**: Since the token itself contains all the information, the server doesn’t need to store session data in memory.
- **Self-contained**: It includes everything needed to verify the token and user claims.
- **Expiration**: JWTs can have an expiration (`exp` field), making them temporary and enhancing security.
  
### Use Cases:
- **Authentication**: Used in Single Sign-On (SSO) and token-based authentication.
- **Authorization**: Validates the user’s permissions to access specific resources.

## 2. **API Keys**

An API Key is a simple string of characters that is used to authenticate requests made to an API. It is often used for identifying the calling project or application.

### How API Keys work:
1. **Generate the API key**: The server generates a unique API key for a user or an application.
2. **Include API key in requests**: The client includes the API key in the request headers or URL parameters when calling the API:
   ```http
   GET /api/resource?apiKey=your_api_key
   ```
   or
   ```http
   Authorization: Api-Key your_api_key
   ```
3. **Validation on the server**: The server checks the API key in the incoming request against its stored list of keys. If valid, the request is allowed to proceed.

### Key Features of API Keys:
- **Simple**: They are just strings, easy to implement, and require minimal computational overhead.
- **Limited access**: An API key can be associated with a specific set of permissions, such as read-only access.
- **Less secure**: API keys can be less secure if not handled carefully (e.g., if exposed in URLs or in publicly accessible client-side code).

### Use Cases:
- **Public API access**: For example, Google Maps, OpenWeather, etc., often require API keys to limit access and track usage.
- **Rate limiting**: API keys help in rate limiting by identifying which user/application is making requests.

### **Comparison:**

| Feature                | JWT Tokens                            | API Keys                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**             | Used for authentication and authorization | Used to identify and authenticate requests |
| **State**               | Stateless (contains user information) | Can be stateless but often tied to user or app |
| **Security**            | More secure due to signatures and expiration | Less secure (can be exposed if not handled properly) |
| **Complexity**          | More complex (includes header, payload, signature) | Simple string value |
| **Expiration**          | Supports expiration (`exp` claim)     | Does not expire by default (unless managed manually) |
| **Use Case**            | Authorization (e.g., access control for users) | Public API access, simple user tracking |
| **Implementation**      | Requires signing, token parsing, and validation | Easier to implement; no need for signatures |

### Which one to use?
- **Use JWT** when you need more secure, scalable, stateless authentication that supports user information and expiration.
- **Use API Keys** when you need a simple and easy way to authenticate API requests, especially in public-facing APIs where sessions or user identity management is not required.

### Conclusion:
- **JWT** tokens are more powerful and secure, ideal for managing authentication and authorization, especially for user-specific actions.
- **API keys** are simpler, best for public APIs or services where the authentication needs are basic and where managing sessions is not required.
