For a **frontend developer**, CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) and deployment-related questions focus on automation, performance, security, and efficient delivery of applications. Below are some **common interview questions** along with **sample answers** where applicable.

---

### **1. CI/CD Fundamentals**
#### **Q1. What is CI/CD, and why is it important in frontend development?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automates code integration from multiple developers, running tests to detect errors early.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery):** Automates the deployment of applications after successful testing.
- **Importance in frontend:** Ensures quick feedback, catches bugs early, and enables fast, reliable releases.

### **2. CI/CD Tools and Workflow**
#### **Q2. Which CI/CD tools have you used, and how do they integrate with frontend projects?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- **Common tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, CircleCI, TravisCI, Bitbucket Pipelines.
- **Integration with frontend:** 
  - Linting (ESLint, Prettier).
  - Running unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library).
  - Building the app (Webpack, Vite, Babel).
  - Deployment (Netlify, Vercel, AWS, Firebase).

#### **Q3. Can you describe a typical frontend CI/CD pipeline?**
âœ… **Answer:**
A typical pipeline includes:
1. **Code commit** â€“ Developer pushes changes to a Git branch.
2. **Linting and formatting** â€“ Run ESLint/Prettier to enforce standards.
3. **Unit & integration tests** â€“ Execute Jest, Cypress, or Playwright tests.
4. **Build process** â€“ Webpack/Vite compiles assets and optimizes for production.
5. **Code quality checks** â€“ SonarQube or Lighthouse reports.
6. **Deployment** â€“ Deploy to **staging** first, then **production** if tests pass.

### **3. Build & Deployment Optimization**
#### **Q4. How can you optimize frontend builds in a CI/CD pipeline?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- **Reduce build times:** Use **caching** (e.g., npm/yarn cache, Docker layer caching).
- **Minify assets:** Tree shaking, code splitting, gzip/brotli compression.
- **Parallel jobs:** Run tests and linting in parallel.
- **Incremental builds:** Use **TurboRepo** or **Bazel** to build only changed files.
- **Static analysis tools:** Pre-check PRs with tools like ESLint and TypeScript.

#### **Q5. How do you manage environment variables in frontend CI/CD pipelines?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- Use **.env files** but avoid checking them into Git.
- Store sensitive values in **GitHub Secrets, GitLab Variables, AWS SSM**.
- Inject them at build time via:
  ```sh
  REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com npm run build
  ```
- In **Next.js**, use `process.env` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

### **4. Testing and Quality Assurance**
#### **Q6. What types of tests should be included in a frontend CI/CD pipeline?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- **Unit tests** â€“ Test individual components/functions (Jest, React Testing Library).
- **Integration tests** â€“ Test interactions between components/services (Cypress, Playwright).
- **End-to-end (E2E) tests** â€“ Simulate real user behavior (Cypress, Selenium).
- **Performance tests** â€“ Lighthouse, Web Vitals monitoring.
- **Security checks** â€“ OWASP security scans, dependency audits (`npm audit`, `Snyk`).

#### **Q7. How do you handle flaky tests in CI/CD?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- Retry failed tests automatically (`--retry` flag in Cypress).
- Use **mocking** to reduce external dependencies.
- Increase **timeouts** for slow network requests.
- Run tests in **parallel** to reduce load on CI.

---

### **5. Deployment Strategies**
#### **Q8. What deployment strategies have you used for frontend applications?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- **Blue-Green Deployment** â€“ Deploy new version alongside the old one, switch traffic when stable.
- **Canary Deployment** â€“ Deploy to a small subset of users, gradually increasing rollout.
- **Rolling Deployment** â€“ Incrementally replace old versions with new ones.
- **A/B Testing** â€“ Release different versions to different user groups.
- **Feature Flags** â€“ Enable/disable features dynamically using tools like LaunchDarkly.

#### **Q9. How would you rollback a faulty deployment in a frontend application?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- **Versioned deployments** â€“ Keep older builds and switch back (`git revert` or `npm rollback`).
- **Use CDN with cache invalidation** â€“ Rollback by invalidating new assets and serving old ones.
- **Feature toggles** â€“ Disable the buggy feature without redeploying.
- **Automated monitoring** â€“ Alerts on high error rates trigger auto-rollback.

### **6. Performance and Security Considerations**
#### **Q10. How do you ensure a frontend application performs well after deployment?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- **Monitor Core Web Vitals** (LCP, FID, CLS) using **Lighthouse or WebPageTest**.
- **Lazy load assets** (React.lazy(), dynamic imports).
- **Optimize images** (Next.js Image, AVIF/WebP formats).
- **Use a CDN** (Cloudflare, Fastly, AWS CloudFront) to cache assets.
- **Enable Gzip/Brotli compression** to reduce file size.

#### **Q11. What security best practices do you follow in CI/CD?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- **Run security scans** â€“ Use `npm audit`, `Snyk`, or `Dependabot` to check vulnerabilities.
- **Restrict access** â€“ Use **least privilege access** for CI/CD credentials.
- **Enforce HTTPS & Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Environment secrets** â€“ Use GitHub Secrets/AWS SSM instead of hardcoding keys.
- **Automate dependency updates** â€“ Enable Dependabot/Renovate for dependency checks.

### **7. Deployment Platforms**
#### **Q12. What deployment services have you used for frontend apps?**
âœ… **Answer:**  
- **Static Site Hosting:** Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, GitHub Pages.
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS S3 + CloudFront, Azure Static Web Apps.
- **Containerized Deployments:** Docker, Kubernetes (K8s) with Nginx.
- **Server-side Rendering (SSR) & Edge Functions:** Next.js on Vercel/AWS Lambda.

#### **Q13. How do you handle cache invalidation after deploying new versions?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- Use **content hash-based filenames**:
  ```js
  build/main.abc123.js  // New hash for each deployment
  ```
- Set **cache-control headers**:
  ```sh
  Cache-Control: max-age=31536000, immutable
  ```
- Use **CDN purge APIs** (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) to invalidate old assets.

### **8. Debugging and Monitoring**
#### **Q14. How do you monitor frontend deployments for issues?**
âœ… **Answer:**
- **Logging & Monitoring Tools:** Sentry, Datadog, LogRocket, New Relic.
- **Performance Metrics:** Google Analytics, Lighthouse CI.
- **Error Tracking:** Capture **console errors** and **network failures** in production.

#### **Q15. What steps would you take if a frontend deployment broke production?**
âœ… **Answer:**
1. **Check logs & monitoring tools** (Sentry, Datadog).
2. **Rollback immediately** if critical errors appear.
3. **Verify the latest deployment diff** (git logs).
4. **Fix the issue locally & test** in a staging environment.
5. **Re-deploy after thorough validation.**
