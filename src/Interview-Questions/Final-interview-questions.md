#### **3️⃣ React Renders & Updates the Virtual DOM**
- React creates a virtual representation of the UI.  
- On state update (`setCount`), React creates a new virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one.  

---

#### **4️⃣ React Fiber Reconciles & Batches Updates**
- React Fiber algorithm finds changes and determines what needs to be updated.  
- If only the `<h1>` tag is changed, React updates **only that part**, not the whole page.  

---

#### **5️⃣ React Commits Updates to the Real DOM**
- The final UI update is **sent to the browser’s DOM** efficiently.  
- The browser **paints** the changes on the screen.  

---

#### **6️⃣ Browser Rendering Process**
- **Parse HTML & CSS:** The browser interprets HTML and styles.  
- **JavaScript Execution:** React runs, updates state, and manipulates the DOM.  
- **Recalculate Layout & Paint UI:** The browser redraws only changed elements.
