When a **production priority bug** is assigned to you, handling it efficiently and systematically is crucial. Here's how you can approach it:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Acknowledge & Understand the Issue**  
- Immediately acknowledge the bug assignment in your team‚Äôs communication channel (Slack, Jira, etc.).  
- Go through the bug description carefully and check if there are logs, screenshots, or steps to reproduce.  
- If unclear, reach out to the person who reported the issue for more details.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Assess the Impact & Severity**  
- Determine **who is affected** (all users, specific users, admin panel, API failures, etc.).  
- Check if it‚Äôs **blocking critical functionality** or just a minor inconvenience.  
- Review error logs, browser console logs, network requests, and any other relevant monitoring tools (Datadog, Sentry, Kibana, etc.).  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Reproduce the Bug in a Local or Staging Environment**  
- Try to replicate the issue in **your local setup** first.  
- If it only happens in production, use **staging** or feature flags to test safely.  
- If possible, check for recent **code changes, deployments, or configuration updates** that might have caused it.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Debug & Identify the Root Cause**  
- Look for **error messages, console logs, network failures, API errors, or performance bottlenecks**.  
- Use debugging tools like **React DevTools, Redux DevTools, and breakpoints in Chrome DevTools**.  
- If necessary, **pair with a backend engineer** to check API failures or database issues.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Communicate Progress Proactively**  
- If the issue is **critical**, update the team at regular intervals (e.g., every 30-60 mins).  
- If it requires more time, **give an estimated resolution time** based on your findings.  
- If you are blocked, immediately escalate to seniors or the appropriate team.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Apply a Hotfix or Temporary Workaround (if needed)**  
- If the issue is critical and needs an **immediate fix**, apply a **hotfix** with minimal impact.  
- If a **temporary workaround** is possible (e.g., feature flag, disabling a component), suggest it to the stakeholders.  

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Fix & Test Thoroughly**  
- Implement the fix in a **safe, non-breaking manner**.  
- Test across different scenarios, edge cases, and environments.  
- Validate with **unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests** if required.  

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Deploy & Monitor**  
- Once the fix is approved, deploy it following the **CI/CD pipeline** and **rollback strategies**.  
- After deployment, monitor logs and **confirm the issue is resolved in production**.  

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Post-Mortem & Preventive Measures**  
- Document **what caused the issue, how it was fixed, and how to prevent it in the future**.  
- If applicable, add **automated tests or monitoring alerts** to catch similar issues earlier.  
- Share the learnings with the team to **improve overall stability**.
