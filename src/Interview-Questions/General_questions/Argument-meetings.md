When someone in a meeting disagrees with your point, handling it professionally and constructively is key. Here's how you can tackle it effectively:

---

### **1️⃣ Stay Calm & Listen Actively**  
- **Don’t interrupt**—let them fully express their perspective.  
- **Acknowledge their viewpoint** with phrases like:  
  - *"I see your perspective. Can you elaborate on why you feel this way?"*  
  - *"That’s an interesting take. Let’s discuss further."*  
- Stay open-minded and **avoid getting defensive**.  

---

### **2️⃣ Ask Clarifying Questions**  
- Understand **why** they disagree—Is it a technical issue? A business impact? A different experience?  
- Ask questions like:  
  - *"Are there specific concerns you have about my approach?"*  
  - *"Do you see any risks that I might have overlooked?"*  
- This helps you **find common ground** while refining your argument.  

---

### **3️⃣ Support Your Point with Data & Logic**  
- If your argument is backed by **data, previous experience, or industry standards**, present it.  
- Use examples like:  
  - *"Based on performance benchmarks, this approach improves load time by 30%."*  
  - *"In our last project, we faced similar challenges, and this solution worked well."*  
- Keep it factual, not personal.  

---

### **4️⃣ Find Common Ground & Compromise If Needed**  
- If both approaches have merit, propose a **middle ground**:  
  - *"What if we try a small POC and evaluate the results?"*  
  - *"Maybe we can merge ideas—your approach for X, mine for Y?"*  
- If their idea is better, **admit it gracefully**:  
  - *"That’s a great point. I think your suggestion might work better in this case."*  

---

### **5️⃣ If It’s a Stalemate, Defer to Higher Authority**  
- If the disagreement continues, suggest escalating to a decision-maker:  
  - *"Let’s bring in the architect/lead to weigh in on this."*  
  - *"We can document both approaches and get a final call from the product owner."*  

---

### **6️⃣ Maintain a Positive Relationship**  
- End with **professionalism and mutual respect**, even if you don’t agree.  
- Thank them for their input:  
  - *"I appreciate your insights—it’s good to explore different perspectives."*
