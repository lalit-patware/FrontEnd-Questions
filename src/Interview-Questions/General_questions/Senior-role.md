As a Senior Developer, effectively managing tasks and mentoring junior developers requires a balance of technical expertise, leadership, and communication. Here’s how I approach it:

### **1. Understanding the Scope of Work**  
Before assigning tasks, I ensure I have a clear understanding of:  
- **Requirements:** Break down user stories and acceptance criteria.  
- **Complexity:** Identify tasks suitable for junior developers.  
- **Dependencies:** Check if tasks are interdependent or require prior knowledge.  

### **2. Task Breakdown & Delegation**  
I follow a structured approach:  
- **Prioritization:** Assign high-impact or time-sensitive tasks first.  
- **Skill-Based Assignment:** Give juniors tasks that challenge them but are achievable.  
- **Pair Programming or Shadowing:** Initially, I may pair them with a senior for critical tasks.  
- **Code Reviews & Feedback:** Ensure quality through structured PR reviews.  

### **3. Mentorship & Guidance**  
- **Knowledge Sharing:** I conduct regular sync-ups, code walkthroughs, and discussions.  
- **Encouraging Problem-Solving:** Instead of giving direct solutions, I guide them toward finding answers.  
- **Best Practices:** Teach them clean code, performance optimization, and debugging techniques.  
- **One-on-One Sessions:** Provide personalized feedback on areas for improvement.  

### **4. Ensuring Ownership & Growth**  
- **Empower Them:** Let them take ownership of features and involve them in decision-making.  
- **Encourage Documentation:** Helps them structure their understanding.  
- **Monitor Progress:** Regular check-ins to ensure they’re on track without micromanaging.  

### **5. Lead by Example**  
- **Stay Approachable:** Keep an open-door policy for queries.  
- **Continuous Learning:** Encourage juniors to explore new tech and improve their skills.  
- **Recognize Achievements:** Appreciate good work to boost confidence.
