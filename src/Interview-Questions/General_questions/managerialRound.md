Hereâ€™s how you can answer these questions based on your background and Adevintaâ€™s job description.

## **1. Behavioral & Team Collaboration**  

### **Tell me about a time you handled a conflict within your team.**  
*"At Goldman Sachs, we were upgrading legacy packages in our private wealth management portal. A disagreement arose between the frontend and backend teams regarding API changes. The backend team wanted to introduce a breaking change, which would impact our React components. I mediated by proposing a phased rollout with a feature flag, allowing us to validate changes in production without disrupting users. This approach helped us align and avoid delays."*

### **How do you mentor junior developers? Can you share an example?**  
*"At EPAM, I mentored junior developers by conducting code reviews and knowledge-sharing sessions. One junior developer struggled with React state management using Redux. I walked them through a real-world example, explaining best practices for structuring reducers and handling async actions with Redux Thunk. Over time, they became more confident and contributed independently to our component library."*

### **How do you handle feedback (both giving and receiving)?**  
*"I see feedback as a tool for growth. When receiving feedback, I focus on understanding the intent rather than taking it personally. At Goldman Sachs, a lead architect suggested a more efficient way to handle form rendering in our dynamic forms library. I implemented the change and saw improved performance. When giving feedback, I ensure itâ€™s constructiveâ€”for example, instead of just pointing out issues in a PR, I suggest solutions and explain why they would be beneficial."*

### **How do you collaborate with product managers and designers?**  
*"I work closely with product managers and designers to ensure feasibility and smooth implementation. At Goldman Sachs, during the welcome experience module development, the design team proposed high-resolution videos that impacted load times. I collaborated with them to use adaptive streaming and optimized image formats, balancing quality and performance. Regular check-ins ensured alignment and faster iteration cycles."*

### **Have you worked in a multi-disciplinary team before? How did you ensure smooth collaboration?**  
*"Yes, at EPAM and Goldman Sachs, I worked with backend developers, designers, QA, and business analysts. To ensure smooth collaboration, I actively participated in daily stand-ups, clarified requirements before implementation, and maintained shared documentation in Confluence. Using tools like Storybook, I provided an interactive way for designers and developers to align on UI components."*

## **2. Technical Leadership & Problem-Solving**  

### **How do you approach performance optimization in a large-scale React application?**  
*"I follow several strategies:  
1. **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** Used `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to load components only when needed.  
2. **Reducing Re-renders:** Optimized components with `React.memo` and `useCallback`.  
3. **Efficient State Management:** Used Redux and MobX effectively to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  
4. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** In Next.js projects, I leveraged SSR for faster initial loads.  
5. **Asset Optimization:** Implemented lazy-loaded images and used modern formats like WebP.  
At Goldman Sachs, these optimizations improved page load times by 30%."*  

### **Have you faced a challenge where your technical decision significantly improved a project?**  
*"Yes, in the wealth management project, we faced slow load times for dashboards. The issue was excessive API calls due to inefficient state updates. I introduced a caching mechanism using React Query, reducing redundant API calls by 40%, improving performance and user experience."*

### **Can you describe a scenario where you had to refactor a legacy system? How did you approach it?**  
*"At Goldman Sachs, we had a legacy form-rendering library using outdated class-based components. I refactored it to a functional component-based structure with hooks, improving maintainability and performance. The approach included:  
1. **Identifying dependencies** and breaking down large components into smaller, reusable ones.  
2. **Ensuring backward compatibility** by introducing changes incrementally.  
3. **Adding tests** with Jest and React Testing Library to prevent regressions.  
The result was a more maintainable, performant, and scalable codebase."*

### **How do you balance trade-offs between speed of development and long-term maintainability?**  
*"I balance speed and maintainability by:  
- Using feature flags for phased rollouts.  
- Implementing linting and automated tests early.  
- Prioritizing core functionalities before optimizations.  
At Adevinta, where multiple-rollouts and A/B testing are common, these principles will ensure fast yet sustainable development."*

### **Can you describe a time when an A/B test influenced a technical decision?**  
*"While working on an e-commerce feature, we tested different product recommendation layouts. The A/B test showed that a grid layout with prominent images had a 15% higher conversion rate. We then optimized lazy loading and reduced bundle size for a smoother experience."*

## **3. System Design & Architecture**  

### **How would you design a scalable frontend for a high-traffic classifieds platform like Marktplaats?**  
*"A scalable frontend for Marktplaats would include:  
- **Micro-frontend Architecture:** Breaking down the app into independent modules (e.g., Search, Listings, User Profile).  
- **SSR with Next.js:** For faster initial loads and SEO optimization.  
- **Component Library:** A shared component library to ensure UI consistency across teams.  
- **GraphQL for Data Fetching:** To optimize API calls and reduce over-fetching.  
- **CDN Caching:** To serve assets faster."*

### **How do you approach server-side rendering (SSR) vs. client-side rendering (CSR) in React?**  
*"I use SSR (Next.js) for SEO-heavy pages and initial load performance, while CSR is best for interactive, dynamic sections. At Goldman Sachs, I migrated a CSR-heavy page to SSR, reducing first-contentful paint (FCP) by 40%."*

### **How do you handle performance issues in a React application?**  
*"Using React Profiler, Lighthouse audits, and optimizing state updates, code splitting, and caching techniques."*

### **How do you ensure high availability in a multi-tenant platform?**  
*"By using load balancing, fallback mechanisms, and monitoring with tools like New Relic and Sentry."*

## **4. Agile & Engineering Practices**  

### **What Agile methodologies have you used in the past?**  
*"Scrum and Kanban. At Goldman Sachs, I participated in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and backlog grooming."*

### **How do you handle multiple rollouts and feature flagging in an experimental environment?**  
*"Using LaunchDarkly or custom feature toggles to deploy features incrementally and A/B test their impact before full rollout."*

### **How do you ensure code quality in a fast-paced release cycle?**  
*"Through automated testing (Jest, React Testing Library), CI/CD pipelines, and thorough PR reviews."*

### **Have you contributed to defining engineering best practices in your team?**  
*"Yes, at EPAM, I introduced better TypeScript guidelines and testing standards for our component library."*

---

## **5. Cultural & Company Fit**  

### **Why do you want to join Adevinta?**  
*"Adevintaâ€™s mission to enable a circular economy aligns with my values. I enjoy working on large-scale platforms that have a meaningful impact. The opportunity to work with a data-driven, experimental approach using modern React technologies excites me."*

### **How do you align with our mission of enabling a circular economy?**  
*"I appreciate the focus on sustainability and providing a platform for second-hand goods. Technology should drive positive change, and Adevintaâ€™s platform contributes to that vision."*

### **What do you look for in an ideal team and workplace?**  
*"A collaborative, growth-oriented culture where developers are encouraged to experiment and improve both technical and non-technical skills."*
