When a React component updates, the framework uses an efficient **reconciliation** process to update the browser DOM. Here's how it works step by step:

---

### 1. **Triggering the Update**
   - React updates are triggered when:
     - Component state changes via `this.setState` or a `useState` hook.
     - Props passed to a component are updated.
     - A `context` value changes.

---

### 2. **Virtual DOM Creation**
   - React uses a **Virtual DOM**, a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
   - When a component updates, React renders the updated component into a new Virtual DOM tree.

---

### 3. **Diffing Algorithm**
   - React compares the previous Virtual DOM tree with the updated Virtual DOM tree using its efficient **diffing algorithm**.
   - It calculates the **minimum set of changes** required to make the actual DOM match the updated Virtual DOM.

---

### 4. **Batching Updates**
   - React batches multiple state updates to improve performance, especially in event handlers or lifecycle methods.
   - Updates are processed together to avoid redundant re-renders.

---

### 5. **Reconciliation**
   - React applies the changes from the Virtual DOM diff to the real DOM.
   - Changes are granular, meaning React updates only the parts of the DOM that actually changed (e.g., an updated attribute or a text node).

---

### 6. **Rendering to the Real DOM**
   - React interacts with the DOM using efficient APIs like `document.createElement`, `setAttribute`, and `removeChild`.
   - It updates the browser's DOM and applies any necessary changes to the UI.

---

### 7. **Commit Phase**
   - React executes side effects like DOM manipulations, network requests, or logging during the **commit phase**.
   - This is handled in lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`) or effects (`useEffect`).

---

### Optimizations Used
   - **Fiber Architecture**: React uses a Fiber data structure to schedule updates and prioritize rendering tasks efficiently.
   - **Keyed Elements**: Keys help React optimize list rendering by associating Virtual DOM nodes with their corresponding real DOM nodes.
   - **Reusability**: React tries to reuse DOM nodes where possible instead of recreating them.

---

This approach ensures React updates the DOM in a fast, predictable, and efficient manner, avoiding unnecessary re-renders and minimizing performance costs.
