Since your current organization is good, you need to frame your answer positively, emphasizing career growth, learning opportunities, and alignment with your long-term goals rather than dissatisfaction. Given your background, here's how you can structure your response:  

### **1. Focus on Growth and New Challenges**  
*"I have had a great experience at my current organization, where I’ve contributed to building and enhancing a component library, worked closely with product owners, and improved the onboarding experience for high-net-worth users. However, I’m always looking for opportunities to expand my skill set and take on new challenges. The role at [Company Name] aligns well with my expertise in React, TypeScript, and frontend architecture while also offering exposure to [mention specific areas—maybe performance optimization, micro-frontends, or a larger-scale application]."*  

### **2. Highlight Interest in the New Role**  
*"I was particularly excited about this opportunity because [Company Name] focuses on [mention something unique—cutting-edge tech stack, large-scale applications, innovative projects, strong frontend culture]. I want to apply my experience in component libraries, state management, and performance optimization to a team that values scalability and high-quality user experiences."*  

### **3. Mention Future Aspirations**  
*"Looking ahead, I want to deepen my expertise in areas like [mention anything relevant: design systems, accessibility, or full-stack development]. I believe this role will provide the right environment to grow while allowing me to contribute meaningfully."*  

This way, you're positioning your move as a **natural career progression** rather than dissatisfaction with your current employer. Would you like to tweak it based on the specific role you’re interviewing for?
