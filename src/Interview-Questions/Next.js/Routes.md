In Next.js, **App Router** and **Page Router** are two different approaches to handling routing, each with its own features and use cases.

---

## **1. Page Router (Traditional Routing)**
- **Introduced:** Before Next.js 13.
- **File-Based Routing:** Uses the `pages/` directory.
- **Routing Mechanism:** Each file in `pages/` corresponds to a route.
- **Rendering Strategies:**
  - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** via `getServerSideProps`
  - **Static Site Generation (SSG):** via `getStaticProps`
  - **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** via `revalidate`
  - **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** via `useEffect` or API calls
- **API Routes:** Available in `pages/api/`.
- **Data Fetching:** Requires specific functions (`getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, etc.).
- **Layouts & State Management:** Achieved through `_app.js` and `_document.js`.
- **Navigation:** Uses `next/link` and `next/router`.

**When to Use Page Router?**
- When working on legacy projects that rely on the `pages/` directory.
- If you prefer a familiar and explicit way of handling SSR, SSG, and ISR.
- If the project relies heavily on API routes inside `pages/api/`.

## **2. App Router (New Routing)**
- **Introduced:** Next.js 13 and stable in Next.js 14.
- **File-Based Routing:** Uses the `app/` directory.
- **Routing Mechanism:** Each folder inside `app/` with a `page.tsx` file represents a route.
- **Rendering Strategies:**
  - **Server Components (Default):** Fetch data directly inside components.
  - **Client Components:** Use `"use client"` directive.
- **API Routes Alternative:** Uses **Server Actions** instead of traditional API routes.
- **Data Fetching:** Server-side by default; supports React Suspense and Streaming.
- **Layouts & State Management:** Uses the `layout.tsx` file at any level.
- **Navigation:** Uses `next/link` and `useRouter` (for client components).

**When to Use App Router?**
- When starting a new Next.js project for better scalability.
- If you want to leverage React Server Components and better performance.
- When using **Server Actions** for optimized API calls.
- If you prefer a more modular, layout-driven architecture.

### **Comparison Summary**
| Feature               | Page Router (`pages/`) | App Router (`app/`) |
|----------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| File-Based Routing  | `pages/` directory | `app/` directory |
| Rendering Approach  | CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR  | Server Components (default), Client Components (optional) |
| Data Fetching       | `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps` | Fetch directly in Server Components |
| API Handling        | `pages/api/` routes | Server Actions |
| Layouts             | `_app.js`, `_document.js` | Nested `layout.tsx` files |
| State Management    | Context API, Redux, etc. | Uses Reactâ€™s built-in state and context |

### **Final Verdict**
- **For new projects** â†’ Use **App Router (`app/`)** for better performance and flexibility.
- **For legacy projects** â†’ Stick with **Page Router (`pages/`)** unless migrating to App Router.
