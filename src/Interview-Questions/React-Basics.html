React Fragment

In React, a fragment is a lightweight wrapper that allows grouping multiple child elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. It's often used when a component needs to return multiple elements without a parent container like a div. Fragments can be written as <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> or simply <>...</>

you cannot add a className or any other attribute directly to a React fragment because it does not render a DOM element
