### Summary of React Fiber

**React Fiber** is the underlying architecture introduced in React 16 to improve rendering performance and make React more responsive and flexible.

### Key Features:
1. **Incremental Rendering (Time Slicing):**
   - Breaks rendering into smaller chunks to avoid blocking the main thread.

2. **Better Scheduling:**
   - Prioritizes updates, ensuring high-priority tasks (e.g., user interactions) are processed first.

3. **Pausing and Resuming Work:**
   - Allows rendering to be paused and resumed for smoother updates.

4. **Concurrency Support:**
   - Enables background rendering and concurrent updates without UI freezes.

### Phases of Work:
1. **Render Phase (Reconciliation):**
   - Calculates changes using the Virtual DOM.
   - Work here is asynchronous and can be interrupted.

2. **Commit Phase:**
   - Applies calculated changes to the real DOM.
   - This phase is synchronous.

### Benefits:
- Improved UI responsiveness.
- Supports advanced features like **Concurrent Mode**, **Suspense**, and **Lazy Loading**.
- Enables smoother animations and interactions.
- Backward-compatible with older React applications.

React Fiber is designed to make modern UIs more efficient and user-friendly by optimizing how updates are handled and rendered.
