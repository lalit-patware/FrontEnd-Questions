### **Comparison of Redux Thunk vs. Redux Saga**

| Feature                 | **Redux Thunk**                           | **Redux Saga**                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**             | Middleware for handling async logic in Redux. | Middleware for handling complex side effects in Redux. |
| **Implementation**      | Uses functions (thunks) to handle async code. | Uses generator functions (`function*`) to manage async code. |
| **Learning Curve**      | Easy; straightforward to understand and use. | Steeper; requires knowledge of generator functions and effects. |
| **Syntax**              | Simple function-based syntax.             | Declarative and more verbose with sagas (e.g., `take`, `call`). |
| **Use Cases**           | Ideal for simple async logic like API calls or dispatching multiple actions. | Suited for complex workflows, managing multiple effects, retries, debouncing, and cancellations. |
| **Performance**         | Lightweight, but less organized for complex logic. | Structured and scalable for advanced use cases. |
| **Debugging**           | Can be harder to debug as async code is spread across thunks. | Easier to debug due to structured flow and centralized sagas. |
| **Community**           | Larger adoption due to simplicity.        | Popular for advanced side effect handling. |
| **Scalability**         | Limited for large, complex applications.  | Highly scalable for apps with advanced side effects. |

### **Example**

#### Redux Thunk
```javascript
// Action Creator with Thunk
export const fetchData = () => async (dispatch) => {
  dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_START' });
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data });
  } catch (error) {
    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error });
  }
};
```

#### Redux Saga
```javascript
import { call, put, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects';

// Worker Saga
function* fetchDataSaga() {
  try {
    const response = yield call(fetch, '/api/data');
    const data = yield response.json();
    yield put({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data });
  } catch (error) {
    yield put({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error });
  }
}

// Watcher Saga
export function* watchFetchData() {
  yield takeEvery('FETCH_START', fetchDataSaga);
}
```

### **When to Use**:
- **Redux Thunk**: Use for simple applications with basic async needs.
- **Redux Saga**: Use for complex applications requiring advanced side effect management like retries, debouncing, and parallel processing.
