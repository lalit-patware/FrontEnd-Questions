### When to Use Backend Pagination:
Large Datasets:

If the dataset is too large to load all at once, fetching only a subset of data (a "page") from the backend reduces memory usage and improves performance.
Dynamic Data:

If the data frequently changes (e.g., stock prices, user comments), backend pagination ensures that you fetch the most up-to-date and accurate subset of data.
Better Performance:

Reduces the load on the frontend, as only a small portion of data is sent from the server.
Decreases network latency, especially for APIs optimized for pagination with indexing.
Security and Privacy:

Prevents exposing the entire dataset to the client, which could be a concern if sensitive data is included.
Scalability:

Backend pagination scales better as the size of the dataset increases.
Example: Fetching only 10 records per page:

javascript
Copy code
GET /api/data?page=1&size=10


### When to Use Frontend Pagination:
Small Datasets:

If the dataset is small enough to load in its entirety without performance issues, frontend pagination is simpler and avoids additional API calls.
Static or Preloaded Data:

When the data doesnâ€™t change (e.g., a list of FAQs or categories), frontend pagination works well.
Offline Functionality:

If the application is designed to work offline with preloaded data, frontend pagination is a viable option.
Example: Loading all data into an array and slicing it for display:

javascript
Copy code
const paginatedData = data.slice((currentPage - 1) * pageSize, currentPage * pageSize);
### Key Differences:
Feature	Backend Pagination	Frontend Pagination
Dataset Size	Suitable for large datasets	Suitable for small datasets
Performance	More efficient for large datasets	Slower if dataset is large
Data Freshness	Ensures data is up-to-date	May show stale data
Network Usage	Only fetches data needed for the current page	Loads all data initially
Complexity	Requires backend implementation	Simpler to implement
