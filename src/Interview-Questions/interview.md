76. Projects and work experience
¬∑ You‚Äôre working on a React application that involves rendering large lists with thousands of items. The performance is becoming a bottleneck due to unnecessary re-renders, especially when filtering or sorting data. How would you optimize the performance of this?

¬∑ Scenario based questions on achieving accessibility.

¬∑ Experience with react class components, legacy code.

¬∑ React Keys and reconciliation with it. (comparing fiber architecture with old?)

¬∑ HackerRank code application, implement a dynamic solution to render a list, ensuring that the list can be sorted by four distinct categories by four different buttons. Implement the routing logic, where each route corresponds to a different sorting configuration, and the list should sort/update automatically based on the active route as well.
