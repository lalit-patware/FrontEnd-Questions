In JavaScript, **prototypes** are the mechanism by which objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every JavaScript object has an internal property called `[[Prototype]]`, which points to another object (its prototype). This allows objects to share common functionality without duplicating the logic in every instance.

### **Object Prototype Basics**:
- When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript first checks if that property exists on the object itself.
- If not, it looks at the object's prototype, and continues the search up the prototype chain until it finds the property or reaches the end of the chain (`null`).
  
This behavior is called **prototypal inheritance**.

### **How Prototypal Inheritance Works**:
If an object doesn’t have its own property or method, it looks up the prototype chain to see if it can inherit the behavior.

For example:

```javascript
const person = {
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};

const user = Object.create(person); // user inherits from person
user.greet(); // Outputs: "Hello!"
```

In this case:
- `user` doesn't have its own `greet` method.
- The interpreter looks for the `greet` method in `person`, which is the prototype of `user`.
- As a result, `user` can call `greet` even though it doesn't own it.

### **Prototype vs `__proto__` vs `prototype`**:
1. **`[[Prototype]]`**: The internal property that points to an object’s prototype. In most engines, it's accessed via `__proto__` (though not recommended for production use).
   
2. **`Object.prototype`**: The object that is the prototype of all objects. Methods like `toString()` and `hasOwnProperty()` are part of `Object.prototype`, so every object has access to them.

3. **`prototype`**: Only exists on functions (not objects) and is used when creating new objects using constructor functions. This defines the prototype for all instances created by a constructor.

### **Example Using Constructor Functions**:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
};

const user1 = new Person("Alice");
const user2 = new Person("Bob");

user1.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, Alice
user2.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, Bob
```

In this case:
- The `greet` method is defined on `Person.prototype`, so both `user1` and `user2` inherit and can use it.
  
### **Prototypal Chain**:
If you try to access a property on an object and it doesn’t exist, JavaScript will check the object's prototype, and then that prototype’s prototype, and so on, until `Object.prototype` is reached or `null` is found.

Example:

```javascript
const animal = { eats: true };
const dog = Object.create(animal); // dog inherits from animal
console.log(dog.eats); // Outputs: true, found in animal
```

### **Advantages of Prototypal Inheritance**:
- **Memory Efficiency**: Methods are shared between instances, avoiding duplication.
- **Dynamic**: You can modify prototypes at runtime, and the change will reflect across all objects that inherit from it.

### **Summary**:
- **Prototype** is a core concept in JavaScript that allows for inheritance between objects.
- Each object has a `[[Prototype]]` that links to another object, enabling property and method sharing.
- The **prototype chain** is followed when JavaScript looks up properties or methods.
- Constructor functions and `Object.create` are common ways to set up inheritance.
