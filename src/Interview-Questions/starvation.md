In JavaScript, **starvation** refers to a situation where a task or function is unable to execute because other tasks are continuously taking priority, preventing it from being scheduled or executed. This often happens in event-driven systems, like JavaScript's event loop, where long-running or high-priority tasks can block lower-priority tasks from getting a chance to run.

For example, if a series of synchronous tasks or promises with higher priority are continuously added to the event queue, lower-priority tasks may "starve" and not get executed. 

This can occur when:

- You have too many high-priority tasks.
- An infinite loop or blocking code prevents lower-priority tasks from executing.

Proper task scheduling and managing async operations efficiently can help prevent starvation in JavaScript.

// A high-priority task that keeps running continuously
function highPriorityTask() {
  while (true) {
    console.log("High-priority task running...");
    // This loop runs indefinitely, never giving other tasks a chance to run
  }
}

// A lower-priority task
function lowPriorityTask() {
  console.log("Low-priority task finally runs.");
}

// Schedule the tasks
setTimeout(lowPriorityTask, 1000); // This should run after 1 second
highPriorityTask(); // This runs indefinitely, preventing the low-priority task

In this example:

highPriorityTask contains an infinite loop, simulating a high-priority task that never ends.
lowPriorityTask is scheduled using setTimeout to run after 1 second.
Because the highPriorityTask runs indefinitely, the lowPriorityTask never gets a chance to execute. This is an example of starvation where the lower-priority task is blocked.

In real-world cases, this could happen if too many synchronous tasks are executed in the main thread without yielding control back to the event loop for asynchronous tasks like setTimeout or I/O operations.


To avoid starvation, it's important to ensure that long-running tasks are executed asynchronously so that they don't block the event loop. One way to do this is to use Web Workers, which allow you to execute scripts in a separate thread.


function longRunningTask() {
    // do some heavy work that takes a long time
  }
  
  function scheduleTask() {
    if (/* more work to do */) {
      // schedule the next chunk of work
      setTimeout(scheduleTask, 0);
    }
  }
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    // this will be executed right away
    console.log('Scheduled task executed.');
  }, 0);
  
  scheduleTask(); // start the long-running task
