Here’s an explanation of the differences among the provided `useEffect` examples:

---

### 1. **`useEffect(() => {}, [])`**
- **Behavior:** Runs only once after the initial render.
- **Dependency Array:** The empty array (`[]`) means the effect doesn’t depend on any state or props, so it will not run again after the initial render.
- **Use Case:** Commonly used for setup logic like fetching data, adding event listeners, or initializing libraries.

---

### 2. **`useEffect(() => {}, [abc])`**
- **Behavior:** Runs after the initial render and then re-runs **whenever the value of `abc` changes**.
- **Dependency Array:** `abc` is a dependency, so the effect will re-run if `abc` is updated.
- **Use Case:** Useful for reacting to changes in specific props or state variables.

---

### 3. **`useEffect(() => {}, null)`**
- **Behavior:** This will cause an error because the dependency array must be an array or omitted, not `null`. React will throw a TypeError.
- **Correct Use:** Use either `[]` for no dependencies, `[dependency]` for specific ones, or omit the dependency array for the effect to run after every render.

---

### 4. **`useEffect(() => {})`**
- **Behavior:** Runs after every render, including the initial render and any subsequent re-renders.
- **Dependency Array:** Omitted, which makes React assume that the effect depends on everything and should re-run on every render.
- **Use Case:** Rarely used as it can lead to performance issues unless there’s a specific need to act on every render.

---

### 5. **`useEffect(() => { return () => {}; }, [])`**
- **Behavior:**
The effect runs only once after the initial render.
The cleanup function (return () => {}) runs once when the component unmounts.
Use Case: Cleanup logic for effects set up during the component's lifecycle (e.g., removing event listeners, canceling subscriptions).

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Effect runs");
  return () => {
    console.log("Cleanup runs on unmount");
  };
}, []);

| **Syntax**               | **When It Runs**                             | **Common Use Case**                           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `useEffect(() => {}, [])` | Once after the initial render                | Initial setup, API calls                      |
| `useEffect(() => {}, [abc])` | After the initial render and when `abc` changes | Reacting to specific state/prop changes       |
| `useEffect(() => {}, null)` | Throws an error                            | Incorrect syntax                              |
| `useEffect(() => {})`     | After every render                          | Rare use, dynamic calculations                |
