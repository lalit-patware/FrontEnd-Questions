### **What is Hoisting in JavaScript?**
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase. However, **only the declarations** are hoisted, not the initializations.

For example:
```js
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;
```
In the example above, JavaScript "hoists" the declaration of `x` to the top, so it’s as if the code were written like this:
```js
var x;
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
x = 5;
```

For functions:
```js
foo(); // Output: "Hello"
function foo() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
```
Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning both the function name and its definition are available before the line where they are defined.

### **Difference Between `var`, `let`, and `const`**

#### 1. **`var`**:
   - **Hoisting**: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
   - **Scope**: `var` is function-scoped or globally scoped. It's not block-scoped, so it can be accessed outside the block in which it’s declared.
   - **Re-declaration**: You can re-declare `var` variables in the same scope without errors.
   - **Initialization**: `var` can be declared without being initialized.

   Example:
   ```js
   console.log(a); // Output: undefined (hoisted)
   var a = 10;
   if (true) {
     var b = 20;
   }
   console.log(b); // Output: 20 (not block-scoped)
   ```

#### 2. **`let`**:
   - **Hoisting**: Variables declared with `let` are hoisted but not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a **ReferenceError** (Temporal Dead Zone).
   - **Scope**: `let` is block-scoped. It is only accessible within the block in which it’s declared (inside `{}`).
   - **Re-declaration**: You cannot re-declare a `let` variable in the same scope.
   - **Initialization**: `let` must be declared before use (no implicit hoisting like `var`).

   Example:
   ```js
   console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
   let x = 10;
   if (true) {
     let y = 20;
   }
   console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined (block-scoped)
   ```

#### 3. **`const`**:
   - **Hoisting**: Like `let`, `const` is hoisted but not initialized. Trying to access it before declaration throws a **ReferenceError**.
   - **Scope**: `const` is also block-scoped, similar to `let`.
   - **Re-declaration**: You cannot re-declare a `const` variable in the same scope.
   - **Initialization**: `const` must be initialized at the time of declaration, and its value cannot be reassigned (though objects or arrays declared with `const` can be modified).

   Example:
   ```js
   const z = 10;
   z = 20; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
   const obj = { key: 'value' };
   obj.key = 'new value'; // This is allowed (modifying object properties)
   ```

### **Summary of Differences**:
| Feature            | `var`                          | `let`                          | `const`                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Hoisting**        | Yes (initialized with `undefined`) | Yes (no initialization)        | Yes (no initialization)        |
| **Scope**           | Function or global             | Block (within `{}`)            | Block (within `{}`)            |
| **Re-declaration**  | Allowed                        | Not allowed                    | Not allowed                    |
| **Initialization**  | Optional                       | Required before use            | Required at the time of declaration |
| **Re-assignment**   | Allowed                        | Allowed                        | Not allowed                    |
