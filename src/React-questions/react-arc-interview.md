# **React Architecture-Level Questions and Key Concepts**

## **1️⃣ Component Architecture & Design Patterns**

### **Q1. How do you structure a large-scale React application?**
✅ Discuss:
- Feature-based folder structure
- Separation of concerns (Components, Hooks, Utils, Context, Services)
- Code-splitting & lazy loading
- Using Atomic Design or Clean Architecture

### **Q2. Explain different React design patterns you have used.**
✅ Possible answers:
- **Container-Presenter pattern**
- **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**
- **Render Props**
- **Compound Components**
- **Hooks-based composition**

### **Q3. How do you handle reusable UI components efficiently?**
✅ Discuss:
- Component libraries (Storybook, Bit, Design Systems)
- Prop drilling vs. Context API
- Generic & configurable components

---

## **2️⃣ State Management & Data Flow**

### **Q4. What are the different ways to manage state in a React application?**
✅ Possible answers:
- **Local state** (`useState`, `useReducer`)
- **Global state** (`Redux`, `Zustand`, `Jotai`, `MobX`, `Context API`)
- **Server state** (`React Query`, `SWR`)
- **URL state** (React Router)

### **Q5. When would you use Redux over Context API?**
✅ Answer:
- **Redux**: Large applications, complex state logic, caching
- **Context API**: Light global state, theme settings, authentication

### **Q6. How does React implement unidirectional data flow?**
✅ Discuss:
- **Props**: Data passed from parent to child components
- **State**: Managed locally within components
- **Lifting State Up**: Sharing state between sibling components
- **Context API & State Management Libraries**: Avoiding prop drilling

---

## **3️⃣ Performance Optimization**

### **Q7. How do you optimize the performance of a React application?**
✅ Discuss:
- **React.memo & useMemo** (Avoid unnecessary re-renders)
- **useCallback** (Optimize function references)
- **Lazy loading (React.lazy & Suspense)**
- **Code-splitting & dynamic imports**
- **Virtualization (react-window, react-virtualized)**
- **Profiling with React DevTools & Web Vitals**

### **Q8. Explain how React reconciles and updates the UI efficiently.**
✅ Discuss:
- React Fiber architecture
- Diffing algorithm
- Virtual DOM vs. Real DOM updates

---

## **4️⃣ Micro Frontend & Architecture Scaling**

### **Q9. What are Micro Frontends, and how do they work with React?**
✅ Discuss:
- Concept of splitting frontend monolith into multiple independent apps
- Implementation via **Module Federation (Webpack 5)**, **Single-SPA**, or **Iframe-based approaches**

### **Q10. How do you handle communication between Micro Frontends?**
✅ Possible answers:
- **Custom Events** (window events)
- **Shared State (Redux, Zustand)**
- **PostMessage API (for iframe-based MFEs)**
- **WebSockets for real-time updates**

---

## **5️⃣ Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Next.js**

### **Q11. What are the differences between CSR, SSR, and SSG in React?**
✅ Answer:
| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| CSR (Client-Side Rendering) | Entire app runs in the browser after JS loads | SPA, interactive dashboards |
| SSR (Server-Side Rendering) | HTML is generated on the server per request | SEO-heavy pages, dynamic content |
| SSG (Static Site Generation) | Pre-built HTML at build time | Blogs, landing pages |

### **Q12. How does Next.js improve performance over traditional React?**
✅ Discuss:
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** for better SEO
- **SSG (Static Site Generation)** for faster page loads
- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** for real-time updates
- **API Routes** for backend integration

---

## **6️⃣ Testing & CI/CD**

### **Q13. How do you test a React application at different levels?**
✅ Possible answers:
- **Unit Testing** (Jest, React Testing Library)
- **Integration Testing** (React Testing Library, Cypress)
- **End-to-End Testing (E2E)** (Cypress, Playwright)

### **Q14. How do you automate deployments in a React project?**
✅ Discuss:
- CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)
- Containerization with Docker
- Deploying to Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or Firebase

---

## **7️⃣ Security & Best Practices**

### **Q15. How do you prevent security vulnerabilities in React?**
✅ Discuss:
- **Preventing XSS** (Use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` carefully)
- **Avoiding CSRF attacks** (Use CSRF tokens)
- **Protecting API keys & environment variables**

### **Q16. How do you handle authentication & authorization in React?**
✅ Possible answers:
- **JWT-based authentication**
- **OAuth (Google, Facebook, GitHub)**
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**

---

## **🔥 Bonus Questions for Leadership & Experience**

### **Q17. How would you migrate a legacy React app to a new architecture?**
✅ Discuss:
- Refactoring class components to functional components
- Introducing TypeScript
- Replacing outdated state management (e.g., Redux -> Zustand)

### **Q18. How do you handle feature toggles and A/B testing in a React app?**
✅ Possible answers:
- Feature flag tools (LaunchDarkly, ConfigCat)
- Rollout strategies (percentage-based deployments)
